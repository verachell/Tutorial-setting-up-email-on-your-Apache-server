This tutorial covers email for one or more domains hosted on your Apache server. This tutorial follows on from https://github.com/verachell/tutorial-setup-linux-VPS-server-with-apache and https://github.com/verachell/Tutorial-hardening-your-apache-server and assumes you have carried out the steps in those tutorials.
